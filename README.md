# PRT Analyser
This Java application allows one to visualize models of precomputed diffuse radiance transfer and explore the effects of simplifying their representations of geometry and radiance in multiple homebrew formats:
* .pgt - Precomputed Geometry and Transfer
* .pgst - Precomputed Geometry and Band-Split Transfer
* .pgv - Precomputed Geometry and Visibility
* .ptgv -Precomputed Textured Geometry and Visibility

Supported files can be created using [prt generator](https://github.com/jaliborc/prt-generator) and used in [prt demo](https://github.com/jaliborc/prt-demo). This application was based on an unrelated Java application written by [Paul Kry](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/) for one of his classes on computer animation.
